# Bloomery Landing Page

Pre-launch landing page for [bloomery.app](https://bloomery.app) — a mood journaling app built on a "no punishment" philosophy.

## About Bloomery

Bloomery is an iOS mood journal that welcomes you back without judgment. Unlike streak-obsessed apps that punish inconsistency, Bloomery celebrates every check-in as a small act of self-care.

**Coming soon to the App Store.**

## Local Development

Run a local server to preview:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Or:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown).

## Deployment

This site is deployed via GitHub Pages with a custom domain (bloomery.app) through Cloudflare.

## Built By

[Two Desks](https://twodesks.app) — a two-person indie team.
