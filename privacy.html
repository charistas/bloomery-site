                <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                <p>We're building Bloomery because we believe mood tracking apps shouldn't spy on you. That philosophy starts here, with this website.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>This website</strong> collects your email address if you sign up for launch updates. That's it.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Bloomery app</strong> (coming soon) stores your mood data on your device. We can't see it.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>What This Website Collects</h2>

                <h3>Email Signup</h3>
                <p>If you join our launch list, we collect your email address through Buttondown, our newsletter service.</p>

                <p><strong>What we do with it:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send you a notification when Bloomery launches</li>
                    <li>Occasional updates about the app (rare — we're not spammers)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What we don't do:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sell or share your email with anyone</li>
                    <li>Send you marketing from other companies</li>
                    <li>Add you to any other lists</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can unsubscribe anytime via the link in any email.</p>

                <h3>Analytics</h3>
                <p>This website uses Cloudflare Web Analytics — a privacy-friendly analytics service that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does not use cookies</li>
                    <li>Does not track you across other websites</li>
                    <li>Does not collect personal information</li>
                    <li>Only shows us aggregate data (total visitors, page views, countries)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can see that "50 people visited this week." We cannot see that "you specifically visited on Tuesday at 3pm."</p>

                <h2>About the Bloomery App</h2>
                <p>The app isn't launched yet, but here's our privacy commitment:</p>

                <h3>Your Data Stays on Your Device</h3>
                <p>Bloomery uses local-first architecture. Your mood entries, notes, and journal data are stored on your iPhone — not on our servers. We literally cannot access your data because we never have it.</p>

                <h3>No Account Required</h3>
                <p>You can use Bloomery without creating an account, providing an email, or signing in with anything. The app works completely offline.</p>

                <h3>Optional iCloud Sync</h3>
                <p>If you choose to sync across your devices, Bloomery uses your personal iCloud account. Your data goes from your device to your iCloud — we're not in the middle.</p>

                <h3>No Selling, No Sharing</h3>
                <p>We will never sell your data. We will never share it with advertisers. We will never use it to train AI models. This isn't just policy — it's architecture. We don't have your data to sell.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Bloomery is built by Two Desks, a two-person team. You can reach us at:</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>If we change this policy, we'll update the date at the top. For significant changes, we'll notify our email list.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                <p>You can ask us to delete your email from our launch list anytime — just email us or click unsubscribe.</p>
                <p>Once the app launches, all your data is on your device. You control it completely. Export it, delete it, do whatever you want. It's yours.</p>
